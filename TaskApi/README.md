# Task API

## A Simple ASP.Net Core Web API app to accompany the Angular based Task Tracker UI Project.

### Insight
A good friend suggested that I give Angular a try since a lot of .Net Developers seem to be enjoying usingit for their frontend projects.
I used Traversy Media's tutorial project and decided to quickly hack together this API Project to accompany it since the original verison
uses JSON server (A fake REST API) and I had no intent of keeping the project strictly on the frontend side, so I decided to have a little fun
with Angular 13 and ASP.Net Core 3.1 LTS.

This project is not a good one for assesing my skills as I have implemented nothing that's of highg importance in a production API project.
Do stay tuned for that one.

### Verdict
Angular and ASP.Net are great companions, I think the reason why many are so quick to run to React.js and/ or Vue is that the strict nature
of Angular filters out the underdeveloped "Developers" who are often laid off after 6 months of work due to Senior Developers being unhappy 
with them.

That is not to take away due credit from Angular's competition. I personally love react and I plan on using it for small projects but I'd be
lying if I said I don't enjoy working with Angular if I were to choose I'd take Angular since I'm a fan of static typing, good design patterns 
and I believe that Angular does that better than most.
